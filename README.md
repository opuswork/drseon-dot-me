This is my official Django/Python blog that I have done and deployed to shared/cloud hosting account.

I started Python study long time ago, but I haven't done particular project before 2018 because I only had a plan to do something on regardin AI.
But, I realized that Django is a solution which provides quite good web framework to support AI which I can do for myself.

So I focused on python with some automation tasks in system administration and also big data handling at which I have on my own PHP project that I have been working on for a few years.

Anyway, this project is a simple blog that I put articles about what I have done during my DMA(Doctor of Musical Arts) degree program.

I am going to add functions that I need gradually and little by little. I already have another blog with minimalist blog made by HTML5.
This blog is that I put the basic functions already but I am going to customize those functions to add in this new blog.

Procedure of building this blog
1.Simple Post listing 
2.Adding Tag, Comment
3.Vote(like, dislike)
4.Sharing to SNS, sending email
5.Signing in and registering with Google, Facebook, and other SNS account

You will see the steps of this procedure.

Thank you so much.

Everybody! Happy Coding!

PS, ChatGPT is my nice adviser and a teacher for learning Programming.
